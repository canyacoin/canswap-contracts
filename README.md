# CanSwap

## What is CanSwap?
CanSwap uses ethereum-based continuous liquidity pools to allow on-chain conversions of tokens and ether into and out of CAN. 
The continuous liquidity pools are permissionless; anyone can add or remove liquidity and anyone can use the pools to convert between assets. 
The pools rely on permissionless arbitrage to ensure correct market pricing of assets at any time.
